Tab Splitter is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: Anthony Lu

Time spent: 7 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [X] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [X] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. 
  This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] User can select party size to evenly split tip and tab total across entire party

- NOTE: The recording (a .mov file) has been added to the repo itself, instead of a link to an animated GIF, as advised through the Slack help channel.

## Notes

I had attempted to add a settings screen to the app to set default tip percentages. However, I was unsure about how to connect the user inputs on the settings screen
back to the main page with the tip percentage selections. There were also issues with the settings screen crashing the app when moving back to the main screen,
so I chose to add other features that did not require the use of a settings screen.
